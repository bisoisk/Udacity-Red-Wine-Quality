This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

- **Normal**:  volatile.acidity, density, PH

| Property         | r-value |
|------------------|---------|
| alcohol          | 0.476   |
| volatile.acidity | -0.391  |
| sulphates        | 0.251   |
| citric.acid      | 0.226   |

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
